# MSC_Hand_Gesture
This repo contains all the MatLab codes for the project ''The Role of Functional Muscle Networks in Improving Hand Gesture
Perception for Human-Machine Interfaces''.

This includes:
- the code to calculate the MSC matrices for the DB2 NinaPro dataset from the preprocessed data;
- the code to train and test a quadratic SVM using the mean MSC matrices to form the feature matrix;
- the code for plotting the results.
